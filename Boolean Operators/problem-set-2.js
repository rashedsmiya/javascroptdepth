    What would each of these variables evaluate to?

    1. const one = true && "hi";
    2. const two = false && "bye";
    3. const three = true || "meow";
    4. const four = false || "rawr";

    Print them out to the console to see if you got them right.

    HINT: 3 & 4 are more challenging, so don't worry if you don't
    get them right away!
